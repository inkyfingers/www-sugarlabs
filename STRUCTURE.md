## Primary/Secondary Elements

A coherent structure of pages. 
Eventually this will be expressed in an ["information architecture" site map diagram](https://www.google.com/search?q=information+architecture+web+design&tbm=isch).

The elements on the 1st level of the list form the 'primary navigation' that typically appears on a toolbar at the top of the page. 
The elements on the 2nd/3rd levels of the list are the 'secondary navigation' and may appear in a drop down menu on the primary toolbar, or as links inside the landing page each primary element, etc.
